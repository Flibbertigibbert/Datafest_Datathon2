## 1. Project Overview
Title:
**Data-Driven Solution to Improve Student Performance in Ikorodu Community High School**


Objective:
To design a data-driven system that helps improve students performance, focusing on preparing students for key standardized exams like JAMB and WASSCE. The solution will establish a robust data infrastructure, analyze key performance factors, and offer predictive insights and actionable recommendations.

Scope:
The solution will include data collection, storage, predictive modeling, and reporting, aiming to enhance performance through early interventions and data-driven decisions.






## Key Recommendations
1. Early Interventions:
Use predictive insights to provide additional support for students identified as high
risk (tutoring, counseling, etc.).
2. Teacher Development:
Provide continuous professional development for teachers based on their
performance data and student outcomes.
3. Resource Allocation:
Prioritize schools and students with limited access to learning resources and ensure
equitable distribution.
4. Parental Involvement:
Increase communication with parents on their child's progress and offer guidance
on how to support learning at home.
