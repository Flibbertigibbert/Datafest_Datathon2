## 1. Project Overview
Title:
**Data-Driven Solution to Improve Student Performance in Ikorodu Community High School**

## Problem Statement
To design a data-driven system that helps improve students performance, focusing on preparing students for key standardized exams like JAMB and WASSCE. The solution will establish a robust data infrastructure, analyze key performance factors, and offer predictive insights and actionable recommendations.


## Project Description
Ikorodu Community School contacted us as consultants to help them build a solution that proactively leverages data to improve candidatesâ€™ performance in not just JAMB, but all their upcoming final exams.

The solution will include data collection, storage, predictive modeling, and reporting, aiming to enhance performance through early interventions and data-driven decisions.
 
The project includes steps for setting up a virtual environment, installing necessary packages, and running a machine learning model using Python.

## Key Recommendations
1. Early Interventions:
Use predictive insights to provide additional support for students identified as high
risk (tutoring, counseling, etc.).
2. Teacher Development:
Provide continuous professional development for teachers based on their
performance data and student outcomes.
3. Resource Allocation:
Prioritize schools and students with limited access to learning resources and ensure
equitable distribution.
4. Parental Involvement:
Increase communication with parents on their child's progress and offer guidance
on how to support learning at home.
